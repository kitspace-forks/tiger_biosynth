# tiger_biosynth
A simple circuit based on CD4093 that sensitive to MOISTURE and organic matter through resistivity of the object.
The circuit react to the resistance and convert it to lights and sounds using the oscillator function of NAND gate in CD4093. 

Tiger biosynth is developed by Squaresolid (Andreas Siagian), Lifepatch - citizen initiative in art, science and technology
